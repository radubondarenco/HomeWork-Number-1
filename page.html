		The best Blockchain in the world!

		The DFINITY Foundation is a not-for-profit[1] organisation developing the Internet Computer. The Internet Computer
		is a public blockchain platform which is based on a network of sub-blockchains governed by an ownerless master
		blockchain. The web3 platform is designed to enhance the Internet with a new form of server-less
		cloud-functionality. Its internal cryptocurrency ICP is the short form of its underlying protocol, the Internet
		Computer Protocol
	</p>
	<p>
		The Internet Computer (ICP) is the first World Computer blockchain, powered by innovations in cryptography and
		computer science derived from deep crypto research begun in 2015. It is a limitless blockchain that hosts and runs
		smart contracts with efficiency comparable to traditional centralized IT infrastructure. Smart contracts gain
		superpowers, and they can now serve web experiences, securely interact with Web2, and create signed transactions
		that run on other blockchains. As a World Computer blockchain, it supports the full end-to-end decentralization of
		online systems and services, which can now be built entirely on-chain exclusively from smart contracts, without the
		need for centralized traditional IT and Big Tech's cloud services.

	<p>
		Although Internet Computer (ICP) doesnâ€™t have the catchiest name on the cryptocurrency market this project has the
		potential to revolutionize not only the world of blockchain but also the internet itself with its ambitious Web 3.0
		goals.
